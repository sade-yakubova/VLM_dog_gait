TRAIN LORA MODEL:
The dog in the video is a young Rottweiler with black fur and tan markings on its face, chest, and legs. It is wearing a red collar and appears to be walking on a paved surface.

The gait of the dog shows significant asymmetry in its limb movements. The rear limbs appear weak and lack propulsion, while the front limbs are more active and seem to be compensating for the hind limbs. This imbalance suggests a muscular or neurological issue affecting the hindquarters.

There is noticeable lameness in the hind legs, with visible muscle atrophy and an abnormal gait pattern. The dog's tail is held low and slightly tucked between its legs, indicating discomfort or pain.

These symptoms are consistent with conditions such as muscular dystrophy (e.g., polymyopathy), nerve damage (e.g., peripheral neuropathy), or spinal cord injuries affecting the hind limbs.

Without a full veterinary examination, it's challenging to provide a definitive diagnosis. However, the signs strongly suggest a neurological or muscular issue impacting the dog's mobility and quality of life.

For a proper assessment and treatment plan, it's crucial to consult a veterinarian experienced in canine neurology or orthopedics. They may recommend diagnostic tests like electromyography (EMG) or imaging studies (e.g., MRI) to determine the underlying cause and develop an appropriate treatment strategy.

BASE MODEL:
The dog in the video is a 1-year-old Rottweiler. Its gait is characterized by symmetrical limb movements, with no apparent signs of lameness or muscle atrophy. The load on the front and rear legs appears to be evenly distributed, indicating a balanced gait. The pitch characteristics of the gait are moderate in length and rhythm, with the tail positioned in a neutral position.

Based on the observed gait pattern, it is difficult to determine any specific musculoskeletal problems without further information or a professional assessment. However, the dog's gait appears to be normal and healthy.
