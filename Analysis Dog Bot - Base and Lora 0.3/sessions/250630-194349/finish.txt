TRAIN LORA MODEL:
The dog in the video is a medium to large-sized, long-haired black mixed breed with a notable condition affecting its left forelimb. This condition has resulted in the dog being non-weight-bearing on that limb, which means it cannot put any weight on it and walks on three legs. The gait of the dog is noticeably unbalanced due to this limitation.

In observing the dog's movements, there is an evident asymmetry in the limb movements. The affected leg is consistently held back or lifted, resulting in a shorter stride on that side compared to the other legs. The dog’s right front limb appears to bear more weight, as indicated by the greater flexion and movement observed in that leg during the gait cycle.

The tail position is notably high and tense, which could be a compensatory response to maintain balance while walking on three legs. The pitch characteristics of the gait are altered; the stride length is shorter on the affected side, and there is a noticeable rhythm to the gait that suggests an attempt to compensate for the lack of support from the injured limb.

Signs of lameness are evident in the way the dog moves; the affected leg is held stiffly or lifted rather than being in a relaxed position. Muscle atrophy can also be inferred, as the muscles along the affected limb appear less defined compared to the other limbs.

Based on these observations, the dog likely suffers from a condition known as partial paralysis or weakness in the left forelimb, possibly due to nerve damage or muscle disease. Conditions like disc disease, spinal cord injuries, or nerve entrapment can cause such symptoms. However, without a full examination and veterinary diagnosis, a precise identification of the disease cannot be confirmed.

If this is indeed a case of partial paralysis or weakness, it would be important for the dog to receive veterinary care. Treatment options might include physical therapy, pain management, and possibly surgery if the underlying cause is structural damage. Regular monitoring and adjustments to the dog’s lifestyle to manage discomfort and prevent further complications would also be crucial.

BASE MODEL:
The dog in the video is a medium to large long-haired black mixed breed with a non-weight-bearing left forelimb. Observing the dog's gait, there is an asymmetry in limb movements, particularly noticeable in the left forelimb, which appears to be lifted off the ground instead of being in contact with the ground. This indicates that the dog may have difficulty bearing weight on its left front leg.

Regarding the load on the front and rear legs, it seems that the right forelimb and both hind legs are carrying the majority of the dog's weight, as they appear to be supporting the body without any noticeable limpness. The gait rhythm appears to be irregular due to the lack of weight-bearing on the left forelimb, leading to an unsteady gait.

There are signs of lameness or muscle atrophy in the left forelimb, as it is not making contact with the ground and seems to be held in an unnatural position. The tail position is slightly raised, which could indicate an attempt to compensate for the imbalance caused by the lameness.

Based on these observations, the dog likely has a musculoskeletal problem affecting its left forelimb, possibly due to a disease or injury. One possible condition could be a shoulder or elbow joint issue, such as a luxation, arthritis, or tendonitis. However, without further examination and diagnostic tests, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made. It is recommended to consult a veterinarian for a proper assessment and treatment plan for the dog's condition.
