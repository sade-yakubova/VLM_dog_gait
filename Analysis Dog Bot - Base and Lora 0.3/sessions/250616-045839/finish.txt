TRAIN LORA MODEL:
The dog in the video has a good gait, with symmetrical limb movements and a good load on both front and rear legs. There are no signs of lameness or muscle atrophy. The pitch characteristics of the gait are good, with a normal length and rhythm, and a neutral tail position. It is difficult to determine any musculoskeletal problems from the video alone.

BASE MODEL:
The dog's gait is not symmetrical, with the front legs moving in a normal manner but the hind legs not swinging properly. The hind legs appear to be carrying the dog's weight, causing them to move in a stiff, unnatural way. There are no visible signs of lameness or muscle atrophy in the hind legs. The pitch characteristics of the gait are irregular, with the hind legs not swinging properly and the tail held high. Based on these observations, it is possible that the dog has a musculoskeletal problem affecting its hind legs, such as arthritis or hip dysplasia. However, without further information or examination by a veterinarian, it is difficult to determine the exact diagnosis.
