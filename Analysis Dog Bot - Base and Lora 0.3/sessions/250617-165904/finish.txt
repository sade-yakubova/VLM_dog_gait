TRAIN LORA MODEL:
The dog's gait is unsteady and abnormal. The front legs are thin and the rear legs appear to be in better condition. The gait is irregular, with the front legs often lifted higher than the hind legs. The tail position is normal, but there is a noticeable limpness in the front legs. These signs suggest that the dog may have a musculoskeletal problem, such as hip dysplasia or arthritis.

It is important to consult a veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. The vet will likely perform an examination, take X-rays, and possibly recommend joint supplements or pain management to improve the dog's mobility and comfort.

BASE MODEL:
The dog in the video has a gait that is not symmetrical. The front and rear limbs do not move in a coordinated manner, indicating a possible musculoskeletal problem. There is a noticeable limp on the right hind limb, which suggests lameness or muscle atrophy. The tail position is also abnormal, with the tail held high and stiff. These signs are consistent with a disease called degenerative myelopathy.
