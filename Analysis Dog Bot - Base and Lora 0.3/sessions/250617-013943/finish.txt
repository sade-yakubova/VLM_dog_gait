TRAIN LORA MODEL:
The dog's gait is characterized by a noticeable lack of symmetry in limb movements, with the hind legs appearing tucked and underutilized. The dog places most of her weight on the front limbs while the hind legs seem to be permanently displaced. This suggests significant discomfort or biomechanical dysfunction in both hind legs. The knees appear to be permanently displaced, indicating possible issues with joint stability or alignment.

The load on the front/rear legs is uneven, with the front limbs bearing more weight than the rear limbs. This imbalance could be contributing to the dog's lameness or muscle atrophy in the affected hind legs. The pitch characteristics of the dog's gait are irregular, with the tail position being consistently low and tucked between the hind legs.

Based on these observations, it is likely that the dog is suffering from a musculoskeletal problem affecting her hind legs. One possible diagnosis is a congenital condition called "lateral deviation of the tibia," which can cause abnormal alignment of the tibia bone in the hind leg. Another possibility is a degenerative joint disease, such as hip dysplasia or arthritis, which can lead to pain, stiffness, and lameness in the affected joints.

It is important to consult a veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan, as the exact cause of the dog's gait abnormalities cannot be determined without further examination and diagnostic tests.

BASE MODEL:
The dog's gait is characterized by a lack of symmetry in limb movements, with the hind legs appearing tucked and underutilized. The load on the front legs is significantly greater than on the rear legs, indicating an imbalance in weight distribution. There are signs of lameness or muscle atrophy in the hind legs, as they appear weak and underdeveloped. The pitch characteristics of the gait are irregular, with an uneven length and rhythm, and the tail position is not consistent.

Based on these observations, it appears that the dog may have a musculoskeletal problem such as arthritis, hip dysplasia, or muscular dystrophy affecting her hind legs. However, without further information or a professional veterinary examination, it is difficult to provide a definitive diagnosis.
