TRAIN LORA MODEL:
The dog in the video is a 1-year-old Rottweiler. The gait of the dog shows an asymmetrical movement pattern, with the left front limb being raised higher than the right front limb. The load on the front legs appears to be uneven, with the left front leg bearing more weight than the right front leg. There are signs of lameness or muscle atrophy in the left hind leg, as it appears to be thinner and less muscular compared to the right hind leg. The pitch characteristics of the gait are irregular, with the left front limb being raised higher and the tail being held lower than normal. Based on these observations, it is possible that the dog may have a musculoskeletal problem affecting its left hind leg. However, without further information or a veterinary examination, it is difficult to provide a definitive diagnosis.

BASE MODEL:
The dog in the video is a 1-year-old Rottweiler. The gait of the dog shows some irregularities. The dog's limb movements are not symmetrical, with the front legs lifting higher than the hind legs. There is also an abnormal load on the front and rear legs, which may indicate lameness or muscle atrophy. The pitch characteristics of the gait are also irregular, with a shorter length and less rhythm. The tail position is also abnormal, with a lower position than normal. Based on these observations, it is possible that the dog may have a musculoskeletal problem such as hip dysplasia or arthritis. However, without further information or a veterinary examination, it is difficult to determine the exact diagnosis.
